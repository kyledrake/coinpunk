# Installing on Ubuntu 12.10

This installation guide was created for and tested on Fedora 17. Please read [`doc/install/requirements.md`](./requirements.md) for hardware and OS requirements.

## Overview

This guide sets up a production server running Coinpunk. The basic procedure includes:

* Installing packages
* Installing, configuring and starting bitcoind
* Installing Coinpunk
* Installing and configuring the SQL database
* Installing Ruby Gems
* Configuring Nginx

## Installing packages

First, update your package list. If your `sudo` is not present, you should run the update commands as root, and then run `apt-get install sudo`:

    sudo yum update

Now you will need to install the necessary packages:

    sudo yum install redis ntp make automake autoconf gcc gcc-c++ zlib-devel libyaml-devel openssl-devel gdbm-devel readline-devel ncurses-devel libffi-devel git libxml2-devel libxslt-devel libicu-devel

Now, you need to install Ruby. There are two ways to do this. The first way is to install ruby using the package system:

    sudo yum install ruby ruby-devel irb rubygems

If you would rather compile ruby from source, [download the latest version of ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads) and install from source:

    gzip -dc ruby-2.0.0-p195.tar.gz | tar xvf -w
    cd ruby-2.0.0-p195
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
    
Now you will need to install bundler, which will download and compile the needed dependencies:

    sudo gem install bundler

## Installing, configuring and starting bitcoind

You can install bitcoind from the [bitcoin.org](http://bitcoin.org/en/download).
Once the download has finished, extract the archive:

    tar -xzvf bitcoin-0.8.1-linux.tar.gz

Then copy either `bin/32/bitcoind` or `bin/64/bitcoind` (depending on your
architecture) into `/usr/local/bin/`.

    # 64bit
    sudo cp bitcoin-0.8.1-linux/bin/64/bitcoind /usr/local/bin
    # 32bit
    sudo cp bitcoin-0.8.1-linux/bin/32/bitcoind /usr/local/bin

Now you will need to create a `.bitcoin` folder to store your data and config for bitcoind:

    mkdir ~/.bitcoin

Create a `bitcoin.conf` file, and add the following values:

    echo "gen=0" > ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
    echo "rpcuser=YOURRPCUSER" >> ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
    echo "rpcpassword=YOURRPCPASS" >> ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
    echo "maxconnections=3" >> ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf

Start the bitcoind server:

    bitcoind --daemon
    
Bitcoind will take several hours to catch up with the bitcoin network, so please be patient.

If you want bitcoind to run again, add this to `/etc/rc.local`:

    /usr/bin/sudo -u YOURSHELLUSERNAME sh -c "/usr/bin/bitcoind -daemon"

We will have a bitcoind service file you can install coming soon.

## Installing Coinpunk

Now you will need to clone Coinpunk:

    git clone https://github.com/kyledrake/coinpunk.git
    cd coinpunk
    
Copy the `config.yml.template` to `config.yml`:

    cp config.yml.template config.yml
    
Now you will need to edit config.yml using `vi`, `nano` or a similar editor. Provide a random alpha-numeric value for `session_secret`, create a unique username and password for `bitcoind_rpcuser` and `bitcoind_rpcpassword`, and optionally add `bitcoind_rpchost` if you plan to access bitcoind from a different (non-localhost) server.

Your `config.yml` should look something this (with an optional `development` and `test` config if you're doing non-production work):

    production:
      database: 'sqlite://coinpunk.sqlite3'
      session_secret: RANDOMSECRET
      bitcoind_rpcuser: YOURRPCUSER
      bitcoind_rpcpassword: YOURRPCPASS

## Installing and configuring the SQL database

If you don't have a preference for SQL databases, you can use SQLite, which will just store data in a file in the root of your application. The config.yml is configured this way by default. If you want to use PostgreSQL or MySQL, use `postgres` or `mysql2` for the schema, respectively.

To install:

    sudo yum install sqlite-devel

If you would like to use MySQL or PostgreSQL, simply change the database config to point to your database. For example, with PostgreSQL, you would use `postgres://USER:PASS@localhost/coinpunk`.

## Installing Ruby Gems

Now you will need to run `bundle install` to grab the required code. First, go to the `coinpunk` directory:

    cd coinpunk

If you are just using Sqlite3 (default), run this:

    sudo bundle install --without development test postgres mysql

If you are using PostgreSQL:

    sudo bundle install --without development test sqlite mysql

If you are using MySQL:

    sudo bundle install --without development test sqlite postgres

## Starting Coinpunk

You can start Coinpunk with the following command:

    ./start

It starts on port `5678` by default, but you may want to set it to a specific port:

    ./start -p 10000

You can ensure this application gets started on system reboot by adding an entry to `/etc/rc.local`:

    /usr/bin/sudo -u YOURSHELLUSERNAME sh -c "/home/YOURSHELLUSERNAME/coinpunk/start -p 10000"

We will eventually have a service file you can install. If you would like to contribute one, please let us know!

## Configuring Nginx

Instead of running this service directly on port 80, most people opt to use NGINX. We will have an install guide for setting up nginx coming soon.

## Final Thoughts

This is an early install guide. It will become simpler eventually, and may have issues. If you run into any, please let us know so we can fix them (better yet, submit pull requests fixing them).
